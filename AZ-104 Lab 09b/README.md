## Lab 09b - Implement Azure Container Instances <br /> Student lab manual

### Lab scenario  
Contoso wants to find a new platform for its virtualized workloads. You identified a number of container images that can be leveraged to accomplish this objective. Since you want to minimize container management, you plan to evaluate the use of Azure Container Instances for deployment of Docker images.  

### Objectives  
In this lab, you will:

* Task 1: Deploy a Docker image by using the Azure Container Instance  
* Task 2: Review the functionality of the Azure Container Instance  
* [Detailed explanation and actions required for each step](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/Instructions/Labs/LAB_09b-Implement_Azure_Container_Instances.html)
