## Homework 11 - Lab 06 - Implement Traffic Management  

<br />

### Lab scenario  
You were tasked with testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and spoke network topology, which Contoso considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of creating the mesh topology, which you tested in the previous lab). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).

### Objectives 
In this lab, you will:

Task 1: Provision the lab environment
Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology
Task 3: Test transitivity of virtual network peering
Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology
Task 5: Implement Azure Load Balancer
Task 6: Implement Azure Application Gateway

### Review
In this lab, you have:

Provisioned the lab environment  
Configured the hub and spoke network topology  
Tested transitivity of virtual network peering  
Configuref routing in the hub and spoke topology  
Implemented Azure Load Balancer  
Implemented Azure Application Gateway
