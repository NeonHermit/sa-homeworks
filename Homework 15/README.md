## Homework 15 - Kubernetes Storage

Kubernetes is a free and open-source container orchestration platform. It provides services and management capabilities needed to efficiently deploy, operate, and scale containers in a cloud or cluster environment.

When managing containerized environments, Kubernetes storage is useful for storage administrators, because it allows them to maintain multiple forms of persistent and non-persistent data in a Kubernetes cluster. This makes it possible to create dynamic storage resources that can
serve different types of applications.
